    <p>The <b>Target Location</b> is the main sub-element of a 
    <a href="2A_context.html">Software Context</a> and in some
    way, a key part of the
    <a href="1A_manager.html">Manager</a>. Since the 
    <a href="1A_manager.html">Manager</a> is due to apply and 
    manage Mods (modifications) for a third-party softwares (or 
    games), the relation between the third-party software and Mods 
    (modifications) to be installed is at center of its procedures. 
    The <i>Target Location</i> is the entity that incarnate this 
    relation, it is the route between the 
    <a href="1A_manager.html">Manager</a> and the third-party 
    software.</p>

    <h2>Target Location Overview</h2>
    <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------- -->
    
    <p>A good way to understand <i>Target Location</i> is to view it as a 
    port of the <a href="1A_manager.html">Manager</a> that 
    both serve as warehouse and make a route to the third-party 
    software. The <i>Target Location</i> not only describes a route to 
    the third-party software, it also hold - in tis default 
    configuration - in its own folder the subfolders dedicated to 
    store <a href="2C_package.html">Packages</a> (Mods) 
    and backup data.</p>
    
    <p>The <i>Target Location</i> embed many parameters such as Network
    repositories or how to store backup data, but the most important, 
    it defines three key parameters to interact wit the third-party 
    software:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b>The <i>Target Destination</i> folder</b>
        <p>This is the folder where the 
        <a href="2C_package.html">Packages</a>'s (Mods) files are 
        copied (installed) to modify the targeted third-party software. 
        This is usually the third-party software root (or installation) 
        folder.</p>
      </li>
      <li><b>The <i>Library</i> folder</b>
        <p>This is the folder where the 
        <a href="1A_manager.html">Manager</a>
        seeks for available <a href="2C_package.html">Packages</a>
        to be installed into the <i>Target Destination</i> folder.</p>
        
        <p>The <a href="2C_package.html">Packages</a> are 
        (should be) created by developers in accordance to the 
        third-party file tree and the <i>Target Destination</i> folder 
        to be properly installed, this is why a <i>Library</i> folder is 
        usually very specific to one particular <i>Target Location</i> 
        and should never be shared between several ones.</p>

        <blockquote class="note icon-info">
        See the <a href="2C_package.html">Mod Package chapter</a> 
        for more informations about the Target Destination folder, the 
        <a href="2C_package.html">Packages</a>'s architecture 
        and how they are installed.
        </blockquote>
          
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li><b>The <i>Backup</i> folder</b>
        <p>This is the folder where the 
        <a href="1A_manager.html">Manager</a> will store 
        backup of third-party software's overwritten files and  the  
        related restoration informations so to be able to properly  
        uninstall <a href="2C_package.html">Packages</a> and 
        restore the third-party software files to their original 
        state.</p>
        
        <p>The Backup folder is a sensitive part, if this folder
        is deleted, or its content alterated, the 
        <a href="1A_manager.html">Manager</a> will no longer
        be able to restore the original third-party software files.</p>
        
        <blockquote class="note icon-note">
        The way the <a href="1A_manager.html">Manager</a>
        create and store backup data should allow this folder to be
        shared between several <i>Target Location</i>. However because a 
        small risk of name collision remains, and because mixed backup 
        data would be harder to identify in case of manual intervention, 
        this is not encouraged.

    <h3>The Target Location home folder</h3>
    <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------- -->
    
    <p>Like its parent element (<a href="2A_context.html">Software 
    Context</a>) the <i>Target Location</i> takes place in its 
    <i>home folder</i> where are placed the <i>Location definition</i> 
    file (.oml) itself and, in its default configuration, one 
    <i>Library</i> subfolder to place aivailable <a href="2C_package.html">Packages</a> and a 
    <i>Backup</i> subfolder to store backup data.</p>
    
    <img src="../images/2B_loc_home.png"/>
    
    <p>Any <i>Target Location</i> must have its own <i>home folder</i>, 
    not shared with another, itself placed intot a 
    <a href="2A_context.html">Software Context</a>'s 
    <i>home folder</i>.</p> 
    
    <blockquote class="note icon-note">
    The <i>Target Location</i> <i>home folder</i> can be renamed as 
    wants. The definition file can also be renamed and <u>not</u> 
    necessarily identical to its home folder.
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>A <i>Target Location</i> <i>home folder</i> alone out
      of a <a href="2A_context.html">Software Context</a>'s <i>home 
      folder</i> <u>is unusable</u>.</li> 
      
      <li>A <i>Target Location definition</i> file (.oml) alone, 
      out of its <i>home folder</i> (eg. directly placed into the <a href="2A_context.html">Software 
      Context</a> <i>home folder</i>) <u>is unusable</u>.</li>
      
      <li>A <i>Target Location</i> <i>home folder</i> within another 
      subfolder of a <a href="2A_context.html">Software Context</a>'s <i>home 
      folder</i> <u>will be unreachable</u>.</li> 
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>The reason is that <i>Target Locations</i> 
    are discovered during <a href="2A_context.html">Software Context</a> 
    loading in a specific way: 
    When a <a href="2A_context.html">Software Context</a> loads, 
    the <a href="1A_manager.html">Manager</a> seeks for 
    subfolders within the <a href="2A_context.html">Software 
    Context</a>'s <i>home folder</i>, in each subfolder search for a 
    <i>Target Location definition</i> 
    file (.oml) and if found, loads the <i>Target 
    Location</i> like a 
    <a href="2A_context.html">Software Context</a>'s module. So, 
    <u><i>Target Locations</i> and 
    <a href="2A_context.html">Software Context</a> are not 
    formally linked together</u>, this linking is dynamic, created at 
    <a href="2A_context.html">Software Context</a> loading 
    depending on found <i>Target Locations</i> within the 
    <a href="2A_context.html">Software Context</a>'s <i>home folder</i>.</p>
    
    <blockquote class="note icon-note">
    What should be understood here is that it is actualy possible 
    to move or copy a <i>Target Location</i>
    from one <a href="2A_context.html">Software Context</a> to 
    another simply by moving or copying its <i>home folder</i> with its 
    content from a <a href="2A_context.html">Software Context</a> 
    <i>home folder</i> to another one.
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>In default configuration, a <i>Target Locations</i> <i>home 
    folder</i> contain the two Library and Backup subfolders. 
    However they are not necessarly used since <i>Target Locations</i> 
    options allow to use custom external folders instead of the 
    default ones. This subject is more detailed in <a href="#ovw_sub">the 
    dedicated section bellow</a>.</p>

    <p><b><a href="#title">Back to top</a></b></p>
    
    <a id="ovw_def"></a>
    <h3>The Target Location definition (.OML) file</h3>
    <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------- -->
    
    <p>The parameters related to a <i>Target Locations</i> is saved in 
    a file with the OML extension (.oml). This is the first file created 
    within the <i>home folder</i> and it is the file 
    <a href="1A_manager.html">Manager</a> seeks 
    for to set a <i>Software Context</i> subfolder as a <i>Target 
    Location</i> <i>home</i>.
    </p>
    
    <p><u>The location of the <i>Target Locations</i> <i>definition file</i> 
    determins the  <i>Target Locations</i> <i>home folder</i></u>. In other 
    words, if you move the <i>definition file</i> to another <i>Software 
    Context</i> <i>home</i>'s direct subfolder, the new subfolder where 
    you moved the <i>definition file</i> will becomes its <i>home 
    folder</i>, and this whatever its content.
    </p>
    
    <blockquote class="note icon-note">
    The OML file is actualy a standard UTF-8 encoded XML file. It 
    can be viewed and edited using any text editor supporting UTF-8 
    encoding.

    <h3>Custom Library and Backup folders</h3>
    <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------- -->
    
    <p>In the default configuration, the <i>Library</i> and 
    <i>Backup</i> folders are direct subfolders within the <i>Target 
    Location</i>'s <i>home folder</i>. Not only by convenience but 
    also because this is <u>technically relevant</u>:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        First, the backup data are related to alterated files of 
        the <i>Target Location</i>'s <i>Destination</i> folder, 
        it is so better to keep all backup data related to one 
        <i>Target Location</i> together and apart of others.
      </li>
    
      <li>
        Second, <a href="2C_package.html">Packages</a> are created 
        in accordance to the third-party software's files tree and the 
        corresponding root <i>Target Destination</i> folder, so 
        <a href="2C_package.html">Packages</a> mades for one 
        <i>Target Location</i> cannot <u>theoretically</u> be compatible 
        with another one. It is so <u>theoretically</u> useless and 
        irrelevant to mix <a href="2C_package.html">Packages</a> 
        destinated to several different <i>Target Locations</i>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>For these reasons, it is encouraged to use the default 
    configuration, with <i>Library</i> and <i>Backup</i> folders as
    subfolders within the <i>Target Location</i>'s <i>home folder</i>.
    <b>However</b>, because there are always particular case and 
    exceptions and because choice is better than no choice, it is 
    possible to define custom and external folders as <i>Target 
    Location</i>'s <i>Library</i> and (or) <i>Backup</i> folders. These 
    options are perfectly valid and technically transparent. In 
    charge of the  user to be care of what he is doing.</p>

    <p>This properties tab gather parameters related to 
    backup data storage options.</p>
    
    <h4>Store backup data as archive files</h4>
    
    <p>If this option is enabled, the generated backup data are stored
    as archive files (with the OZB extension (.ozb)) instead 
    of regular subfolders within the <i>Backup</i> folder. It is 
    encouraged to enable this option to avoid repetitive creation and 
    deletion of entires trees of files and subfolders within the Backup 
    folder. Using archive files, there is only one file created per 
    <a href="2C_package.html">Package</a> installation.</p>
    
    <blockquote class="note icon-note">
    The OZB format is actually a standard ZIP file with specific
    extension and can be opened either using a specific application or
    via Windows Explorer after having renamed it with .zip extension.
    </blockquote>
    
    <h4>Backup archive files compression</h4>
    
    <p>If store backup as archive files option is enabled, this 
    parameter allow to disable or choose the archive compression level. 
    Notice that the more the compression level is high, the more it 
    require computational ressources and time.</p>
    
    <blockquote class="note icon-note">
    Unless you really need to save disk space, it is encouraged to leave 
    the compression disabled to keep good performances and take 
    advantage of using archive files.
    </blockquote>
    
    <h4>Discard backup data</h4>
    
    <p>This is a kind of <u>emergency</u> process to delete 
    (move to recycle bin) all existing backup data of the current 
    <i>Target Location</i> <b>without restoring them</b>. In other words 
    the backed original files of the third-party software will be 
    deleted (move to recycle bin) without being restored into the 
    third-party software file tree.</p>
    
    <blockquote class="note icon-warn">
    <b>This action should never be done unless very specific cases</b>. For 
    instance, when the third-party software updated itself while 
    some <a href="2C_package.html">Packages</a> still stood 
    installed, turning backup data as outdated by the fact, and so
    not to be restored.
