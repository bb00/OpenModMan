    <h1>Mod Packages</h1>
    <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------- -->
    
    <p>The <b>Mod Packages</b> or simply <b>Packages</b> are the objects
    that apply the modifications to the third-party software. They are
    in some way the heart of the modding process and what the
    Manager is built around.</p>

    <h2>Mod Packages Overview</h2>
    <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------- -->
    
    <p>The purpose of the <i>Mod Package</i> is to provide an easy and 
    standard way to install but also create modifications (Mods) to 
    apply to a third-party software.</p>
    
    <h3>Mod Package base concept and architecture</h3>
    
    <p>Since each (third-party) software have its own file tree and 
    architecture, the Manager canno guess which file must be copied or 
    added where. One solution could be to write, for each package, a 
    kind of script file that tell where to put each file, but for large 
    amount of file this become fastidious for the Mod creator and 
    multply the risk of error.</p>
    
    <p>A good and simple solution allowing to easily adapt genericaly 
    any Mods to any third-party sofrware were found some year ago by 
    other mod managing software. This solution consists on, for the mod 
    creator, to strictly replicate the targeted third-party software's 
    folders tree, in order to allow the mod managing software to 
    perform an automatic comparison, then overwriting or adding each 
    file (or folder) where it is supposed to be within the third-party 
    file tree.</p>

    <p>Since a same third-party software have the same file tree every 
    where it is installed, the only thing the mod creator had to do, is 
    to tell people to find the third-party software's installation 
    folder (root of the file tree), then applying mods from there. And 
    this is exactly the way Open Mod Manager works, through its object 
    of Target Location.</p>
